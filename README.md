# API

This API allows books and authors to be accessed from a mongodb database

## Usage

Please see the manual testing plan to see what is required from your machine. It also contains several examples on how to access the API if there is any confusion. For this project I heavily utilized postman and django for testing and rendering the API.

## Warnings

Please make sure to run the API before starting the web server. Otherwise the website will not function appropriately.
